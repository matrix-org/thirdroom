          Welcome to Third Room: Technology Preview

          Introducing an open, standards-based, decentralised vision of the metaverse for the open Web, built entirely

        <Text variant="c1">Hi all,</Text>
        <Text variant="c1">
          <a href="https://matrix.org">Matrix</a> has always been about more than just chat, and we are incredibly
          excited today to finally publicly debut our first Technology Preview of Third Room - a beautiful new web
          client for connecting to shared 3D (or 2D) spatial environments and applications built on Matrix.
        </Text>
        <Text variant="c1">
          Third Room lets you use Matrix as the platform for a truly free and open decentralised vision of the metaverse
          (or however you refer to interoperable virtual worlds and spatial web applications) - built entirely on open
          standards via liberally licensed open source implementations, and without any dependencies on
          cryptocurrencies, NFTs, or data-hoarding big tech silos. In other words: Third Room will be a blank canvas for
          you to build open metaverse environments and applications in the spirit of the original open Web.

          We see Third Room as a logical extension to today’s Matrix clients. The starting point for a Matrix room is of
          course simple text chat across a decentralised set of users. From there, it’s an obvious extension to add more
          sophisticated collaboration features such as the ability to send files, share locations, send voice messages,
          embed widgets, etc. The next level up from that is to add voip calling, to upgrade rooms into voice and{" "}

          for end-to-end encrypted (E2EE) conferencing. So what if you wanted to go further: to upgrade the room to
          interact together in any way imaginable, building on a blank canvas for open spatial collaboration - pulling
          in people, apps, digital assets and bridged content in order to mix together whatever realtime collaborative
          semantics you want… much like the Web itself lets you go wild with HTML+JS+CSS to build your own webapps? This
          is our goal with Third Room.

          The point of today’s tech preview is to show off the capabilities of Third Room’s engine and spark interest
          from the community in contributing to the project, rather than it being a mainstream-usable app. In
          particular, we don’t yet have persistence, custom avatars, or custom games/experiences hooked up yet. That
          said, there’s obviously some stuff already here for you to play with! To get going, head over to{" "}

          Manifold achieves a stable 60fps on a typical modern laptop - on Chrome on a M1 Macbook Pro, it renders a
          typical scene at 2000x1244px at 60fps, with 13.12ms of unused gametime available for every 16.67ms frame, and
          in Safari 16 it can manage fullscreen 3440x1440px at an easy 60fps(!). It gets this crazy performance by
          extensive use of lock-free data structures built with SharedArrayBuffers and Atomics - producing a proper
          multi-threaded, multi-core capable Web-based game engine.

            Hydrogen on a worker if we wanted, but it’s so light it hasn’t necessitated it).
          </li>
          <li>
            The Render thread, which renders the visuals of the world using Three.js’s WebGLRenderer to an
            OffscreenCanvas, and also handles resource loading (although this could be workerised too). Firefox just

            in FF 105, and Chrome already had it: for Safari and browsers without OffscreenCanvas we render on the main
            thread instead.
          </li>
          <li>
            The Game thread, which runs the Rapier physics engine in WASM, actually executes gameplay logic, and passes
            renderable state into the Render thead.

        </ol>
        <Text variant="c1">
          The threads communicate together with a mix of PostMessage and a triple-buffer of SharedArrayBuffers, which
          use Atomics to track which buffer the Game thread should be writing into; which buffer the Render thread
          should be reading from; and which buffer should be written into next. This lets the game engine tick at a
          solid 60fps, while the render thread will run at whatever crazy refresh rate your display has.

          state of all the entities in the world in JavaScript TypedArrays, maintaining a cache-efficient packed data
          structure accessed by all the most performance critical operations in the engine - effectively enabling
          WASM-style speeds without having to resort to WASM.

          We’re releasing the technology preview today to show what the engine is capable of right now, and to hopefully
          spark interest from the community in contributing to the project (especially for technical artists!). But
          there’s lots of stuff left to do:
        </Text>
        <ul className="BlogSection__spaced-list">
          <li>
            <span className="semi-bold">Custom Avatars:</span> At the moment, everyone is shown as a mixamo Y-bot. We'll
            be adding in the ability to set your own rigged avatar asap, needless to say!
          </li>

          <li>
            <span className="semi-bold">User Generated Content:</span> The vision is of course for Third Room to be a
            canvas on which anyone can script their own functionality, just like folks can write Matrix bots, bridges
            and widgets today. However, we haven’t hooked up the APIs yet to let users write their own apps: these will
            likely be sandboxed WASM executables which run in their own thread. Instead, we’re currently limited to the
            functionality hardcoded into the client (move, run, jump, spawn, pickup, throw, etc).
          </li>

          <li>
            <span className="semi-bold">Editing:</span> We have started on a direct-manipulation editor, letting you go
            full Inception or Dark City and get hands on with changing the world; you can trigger it with the <kbd>§</kbd> or <kbd>`</kbd>
            key. Right now it just lets you navigate the scene graph of the world and select the entities, but the next
            step will be to turn it into a full in-world editor.{" "}
          </li>

          <li>
            <span className="semi-bold">Persistence:</span> We don’t yet save world state back into Matrix: when a user
            disconnects, their state and the objects they own disappears from the world. Instead, we should be storing
            glTF blobs into the Matrix room (as plain old files, so that boring old Matrix bots or non-Third-Room
            clients can also manipulate them!) to track the edits to the world, including persisting what the users have
            got up to within it.
          </li>

          <li>
            <span className="semi-bold">VR/AR:</span> We need to flip the bit to enable WebVR / OpenXR support (and then
            tweak the app’s UI to be usable in a 3D environment)
          </li>

          <li>
            <span className="semi-bold">Mobile Web support:</span> Similarly, we need to tweak the CSS and UI to support
            mobile Web. Ironically the engine itself performs excellently on smartphones!

            <span className="semi-bold">SFU VoIP:</span> Currently the WebRTC networking for VoIP and data channels
            operates as full mesh - meaning that each participant has to redundantly send the same traffic to every

          There’s obviously been way too much hype about virtual worlds and the metaverse recently, so it’s important to

            <span className="semi-bold">Web first.</span> Third Room aspires to be the real-time spatial layer of the
            open Web, and as such our primary target platform is of course the Web, building on the incredible advances
            in WebGL, WebRTC, WebXR, WebWorkers and WebGPU in recent years. The Web is finally at the point where it’s
            possible to build a game engine whose performance rivals native applications - and so while many roads into
            the metaverse seem to involve installing enormous proprietary Windows-only native apps via Steam, Third Room
            is available to anyone with a web browser. We’ve tested on Chrome, Firefox and Safari, but it should work on
            any modern up-to-date browser… including on older machines: after all, the Web is for everyone. For
            instance, Third Room runs fine on a 2010 Macbook Air with integrated graphics. Today’s release is desktop
            web only, but mobile web is not far away (and performance is great!). Obviously there’s nothing stopping
            people from also building Third Room compatible native clients too (same as for normal Matrix) - and we hope
            to see Godot, Unity and Unreal clients emerge in due course! But our roots will always be on the open Web.

            Now, the interesting bit is where we hit the edge of the existing standards - for instance, defining how to
            embed glTF into Matrix rooms, or how to extend glTF to describe spatial audio assets. We already have a
            basic Matrix Spec Change (

            ). The expectation is that all these “Metaverse over Matrix” MSCs will end up being a separate annex to the
            Matrix spec, looked after by an domain-specific Matrix spec working group rather than the normal Matrix spec
            core team (and so avoid bloating the core Matrix spec with metaverse-specific stuff).

            Meanwhile, while building Third Room we’ve found ourselves repeatedly hitting the edge of the possible in
            glTF itself - but luckily, much as Matrix has MSCs, glTF has Extensions to let folks experiment with new
            functionality… and we’re proud to announce that the Matrix.org Foundation has formally joined The Khronos
            Group as a non-profit participant in order to formally participate in the spec process for glTF, WebGL,

            <span className="semi-bold">Free, open and equitable.</span> We profoundly believe that the metaverse should
            be free - both free as in beer, and free as in speech. Just like the Web, you shouldn’t have to pay to
            participate, and it should be open to everyone, without walled gardens or silos, and you should certainly
            not have to pay for it with your data or metadata. We want to provide a truly equitable environment where
            everyone is equal to create their own content and participate without intrinsic privilege or inequality. As
            a result, there is no artificial scarcity in Third Room, or virtual real-estate speculation, or intrinsic
            currencies: just like Matrix, everyone is free to participate on a level pegging, and there are no financial
            incentives baked into the system. Of course, folks are welcome to sell or trade content, avatars, assets,
            apps - just like on the Web - and there’s nothing stopping you from using cryptocurrencies either. But the
            platform itself will never have financial incentives or primitives baked in.

            primary platform for Third Room is unashamedly the plain old web browser as viewed on a flat screen -
            although we will of course be adding VR/AR support via WebXR in future.

          It’s worth reiterating that Third Room does not have its own server - it is powered exclusively by plain old
          Matrix homeservers, with no new APIs or functionality required whatsoever. As a result, anyone running their
          own Synapse, Dendrite, Conduit or Construct can go and point Third Room at it and jump straight in. In return,
          Third Room inherits a tonne of amazing features directly from Matrix:

            connect to someone else on a different server without sharing ownership bilaterally with them.
            <br />
            The one exception to this in Third Room is the physics engine: currently, objects are ‘owned’ by the account
            which created them, which then runs the physics simulation for that object and then pushes the results out
            to the other users in the room to update their world view. We are not yet running a decentralised physics
            simulation, sadly :) We have plans to improve this in future however.

          improving Matrix (and Element). For instance we shipped a{" "}

          Also, it’s worth noting that at Element we’ve been showing off Third Room as it develops to a lot of our big
          customers - and in practice there is significant interest from many of our big public sector deployments to
          experiment with Third Room. We are depending on commercial interest to scale up work on Third Room - please
          get in touch if you’re interested in funding. Revisiting the list of use cases above should give you an idea
          of the range of applications that folks have in mind, and we hope that this will be an impetus to grow the
          project and see where it goes!

          Our next main milestone is to release a minimum viable product (MVP) version of Third Room which a mainstream
          audience can use, rather than the technology preview/showcase we’ve released today to developers. In practice,
          this primarily means sorting out persistence, editing, and UGC so that we (and the community!) can start
          creating proper applications on top of the engine. We’re aiming to release the MVP towards the end of the
          year, but meanwhile we’ll continuously deploying thirdroom.io off the main branch of the repository.

          trick which is working so well with Element Call - after all; if you’re already in Matrix in Element (or some
          other widget-capable Matrix client), why shouldn’t you just be able to reach straight into Third Room? This
          will likely come much later.

          Finally: we desperately need 3d generalists, character artists, and environment artists to come work with us
          to help build out beautiful avatars, scenes, assets, and generally ensure that Third Room sets a precedent for
          being beautiful - and to make the most of the engine in general. If Blender is your happy place, please come

          We live in exciting times: it will be fascinating to see how Third Room progresses, and whether it really
          could provide a viable alternative to the increasingly closed/centralised or NFT-focused visions of the
          metaverse which is emerging. But whatever happens, we hope you’re excited to finally play with it as we are!
